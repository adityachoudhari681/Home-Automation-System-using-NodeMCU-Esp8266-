-In this Project, I designed and implemented a Home Automation System that utilized the NodeMcu (ESP8266) microcontroller to control an LED using the Blink IoT app. Here,I aimed to create a user-friendly and efficient system that allowed users to remotely control home appliances with ease.

-This Project can be Scaled up by Integrating a Relay Module with Esp8266 in order to provide the end user to operate AC Devices like Light and Fan Remotely using Blink iot App in Smartphone.
